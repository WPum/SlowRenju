# SlowRenju

SlowRenju is a Gomoku/Renju engine, which supports the [new protocol](http://petr.lastovicka.sweb.cz/protocl2en.htm) of [Gomocup](https://gomocup.org/).

SlowRenju has been developed since January 2012, which is based on iteratively deepening alpha-beta pruning algorithm with a transposition table. SlowRenju has been participating in the Gomoku/Renju AI programming tournament [Gomocup](https://gomocup.org/) since 2013, which is one of the more famous computer Gomoku/Renju tournament now.

_Gomoku_, also known as _Five In a Row_, is a game playing on a 15Ã—15 (or maybe larger) board. Two persons put their own stones on the crossing of the board alternatively, and the game ends with a player winning by creating a line of five stones horizontally, vertically or diagonally, or with a draw by the board filled up with stones. There are also some variants of Gomoku, among which the most famous one is _Renju_, in which the black player (the player who moves first) loses by creating a double-three, a double-four or an over-line.

SlowRenju supports the rules of Freestyle Gomoku, Standard Gomoku and Renju, on the board sizes between 5 and 20.
